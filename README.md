# TypeORM GraphQL API

The idea of this project is to co-locate the TypeORM entity definition with the portion of the 
GraphQL API (typedefs and resolvers) that relate to that Entity. It is an entity-centric approach
to building the GraphQL schema that defines the API.

For an example of this in action, see https://github.com/bkinsey808/angular-offline-first-graphql/tree/master/server
